  <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Services Provided</h4>
  <p class="text-md mb-4">
    Cityfare offers a transportation service connecting drivers and commuters for intra-city travel, pickups, and daily commutes. Through the App, users can identify drivers heading in the same direction and book rides based on proximity and destination. By booking a ride through the App, you agree to provide accurate details of your pickup and drop-off locations. Additionally, users are responsible for confirming driver availability and the estimated time of arrival provided within the App.
  </p>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Payment</h4>
  <p class="text-md mb-4">
    All ride bookings require payment through the Cityfare App. Cityfare offers various pricing packages, including daily, weekly, and monthly subscriptions tailored to different commuter needs. You authorize Cityfare to charge your provided payment method for the full cost of the ride or subscription, including any applicable taxes and fees. All payments are processed securely through our payment gateway, and users can view their transaction history in the App.
  </p>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Cancellation Policy</h4>
  <p class="text-md mb-4">
    You may cancel a ride booking at any time before the driver arrives. However, once the driver has arrived at your location, you may be charged a cancellation fee. For subscription-based users, Cityfare reserves the right to adjust ride schedules to accommodate operational needs. In such cases, users will be notified in advance, and no cancellation fee will apply if Cityfare initiates the changes.
  </p>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Limitation of Liability</h4>
  <p class="text-md mb-4">
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Cityfare is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to personal injury, property damage, or loss of data.
  </p>

  <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">6. Changes to These Terms</h4>
  <p class="text-md mb-4">
    Cityfare reserves the right to modify or update these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of material changes through the App. Continued use of the App after such changes will constitute your acceptance of the new Terms.
